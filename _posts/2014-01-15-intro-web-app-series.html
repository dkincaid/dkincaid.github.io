<p>
I've been thinking about how to build web applications that allow someone to do some data
exploration interactively with some really nice visualizations. There are all kinds of choices such
as <a href="http://rstudio.com/shiny">Shiny</a> for R and generic tools like <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, etc for general use. Of course there are
also tools such as Tableau that provide their own interface. I'll probably try out <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/">Tableau</a> public as
well.
</p>

<p>
Those of you that know me are well aware that I don't build web front ends, so all of this is pretty
foreign to me. So in an attempt to learn about the possibilities and get a chance to play with two
of my favorite tools, R and Clojure, I'm going to try to build a web app.
</p>

<p>
Right now my plan is to try using the following tools in different ways:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://rstudio.com/shiny">R with Shiny</a>
</li>
<li>Clojure
</li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://keminglabs.com/c2/">C2</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/">Tableau public</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see I don't really know what I don't know at this point. The one I'm most familiar with
is R/Shiny so that's what I'll be starting with.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I'm going to use the data from <a href="http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/index.php">Project Tycho</a> at University of Pittsburgh. I'll be using the <a href="http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/data/level2.php">Level 2</a>
data. The data consists of counts of 47 contagious diseases at the city and state level for the period
1888-2013. This seems like an interesting data set that shouldn't be too difficult to work with.
</p>

<p>
I'll use the first implementation in Shiny to explore what kind of visualizations and interactivity
makes sense for this dataset. After that I'll attempt to implement the same thing using Clojure and
some standard web app tools. From there I'll move on to things like d3.js and AngularJS.
</p>

<p>
So, keep an eye out here over the next few weeks as I explore how to build interactive web apps for
data exploration and visualization. If you'd like to follow along with the code I'll be posting it
up to my Github repository <a href="http://github.com/dkincaid/web-app-explore">web-app-explore</a>.
