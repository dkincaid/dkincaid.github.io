I've recently begun working with <a href="http://ctakes.apache.org" title="Apache cTAKES">Apache cTAKES</a> for doing some NLP on medical record narrative data. By recently, I mean about a week into it now part-time. If you've ever worked with <a href="http://uima.apache.org" title="Apache UIMA"></a> before and remember your first days with it you'll understand how difficult it is.

It's not that UIMA itself is difficult, nor is cTAKES very difficult either as long as you either use Eclipse or just want to follow their very limited examples. It's when you want to actually do something with the output AND you don't use Eclipse that you're in trouble and pretty much on your own.
