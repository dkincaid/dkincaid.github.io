title: Using HyperLogLog in Cascalog
tagline: Real world performance benchmarks
excerpt: Several examples of using the HyperLogLog cardinality estimator with Cascalog exist on the web. However, none of them seem to really address real world performance.

Recently I have been working on using the <a href="http://blog.aggregateknowledge.com/2012/10/25/sketch-of-the-day-hyperloglog-cornerstone-of-a-big-data-infrastructure/">HyperLogLog</a> cardinality estimation algorithm with
<a href="http://cascalog.org">Cascalog</a>. As I perused the web for examples of how other people were doing this I was able to find a
couple of approaches to doing it.
</p>

<p>
This post is an off-shoot of <a href="http://screen6.github.io/blog/2013/11/13/hyperloglog-with-cascalog.html">an excellent article</a> on this along with some good discussion about
performance. Before you continue reading this I would encourage you to go over there and at least
skim the article. They did a really nice job of explaining things, so I won't repeat most of it
here.
</p>

<p>
In the article the authors did a very nice comparison of two different ways of using the HyperLogLog
object from the library. Basically you can either use one object and "offer" values to it or create
a new object with your value then merge it with another object that has values already in it. Not
totally unexpectedly the performance is much better if you use one object and add values to it.
</p>

<p>
However, this doesn't take into account some of the optimization strategies that one needs to use
when building MapReduce jobs. One of the things that I have learned while working with Cascalog and
MapReduce over the last year or so is that it is very important to do as much work in the map tasks
as possible. In other words, you really want to minimize the amount of data that needs to pass from
map task to reduce task.
</p>

<p>
So what does this mean in the world of Cascalog? I have interpreted this to mean preferring
<code>defparallelagg</code> to the other custom aggregators when doing
aggregation. The problem is that to do some of the aggregation map-side we don't get a chance to
hold on to any state like we do with the <code>defaggregateop</code>. So our <code>defparallelagg</code> is forced to
create a new HLL object for each one of the tuple values and then merge that object into another.
</p>

<p>
So our parallel aggregator will look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #b294bb;">c/defparallelagg</span> <span style="color: #81a2be;">agg-hyperloglog</span>
  <span style="color: #b5bd68;">:init-var</span> #'hll-construct
  <span style="color: #b5bd68;">:combine-var</span> #'hll-merge)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The way this works is that the function we've defined as <code>:init-var</code> will get called once for each
tuple. In this case the <code>hll-construct</code> function is creating a HyperLogLog object and offering the
tuple value to it then returning the HLL object. Then the function defined as the <code>:combine-var</code>
will get called with the results of the calls to the <code>:init-var</code> functions as well as other combines
until there is only one value left. In this case, the <code>hll-merge</code> function gets two HyperLogLog
objects (either returned from <code>hll-construct</code> or a previous call to <code>hll-merge</code>) and simply merges
them.
</p>

<p>
So what's going to happen in our query is that each <code>?uuid</code> value will be put into a HLL object and
then successively merged into other HLL objects with one or more <code>?uuid</code> values in them. This will
happen first on each map task then those single HLL objects will be sent from the map tasks to the
reduce tasks where they will all be combined (merged). And remember that this combining of HLL's is
happening based on the aggregation grouping in the query (in this case we're grouping by city, year
and day).
</p>

<p>
Here are <code>hll-construct</code> and <code>hll-merge</code>
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #b294bb;">defn</span> <span style="color: #81a2be;">hll-construct</span>
  <span style="color: #b5bd68;">"Construct a HyperLogLog and offer the given init-value. 12 bits gives a little less than 2% standard error."</span>
  [init-value]
  (<span style="color: #b294bb;">doto</span> (<span style="color: #b0c4de;">HyperLogLog.</span> 12) (<span style="color: #b0c4de;">.offer</span> init-value)))

(<span style="color: #b294bb;">defn</span> <span style="color: #81a2be;">hll-merge</span>
  <span style="color: #b5bd68;">"Merge two or more HyperLogLog's together."</span>
  [<span style="color: #b0c4de;">^HyperLogLog</span> first-hlog &amp; hlogs]
  (<span style="color: #b0c4de;">.merge</span> <span style="color: #b0c4de;">^HyperLogLog</span> first-hlog (<span style="color: #b0c4de;">into-array</span> <span style="color: #b0c4de;">HyperLogLog</span> hlogs)))
</pre>
</div>

You can find all of the code that I used in my <a href="http://github.com/dkincaid/cascalog-hll-benchmark">Github repository</a>. Most of the code is directly from
the <a href="http://screen6.github.io/blog/2013/11/13/hyperloglog-with-cascalog.html">original blog post at Screen6</a>. The code for the parallel implementation was adapted from a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cascalog-user/l3H456kmhhQ/-7gfgVZ2xaUJ">post</a>
on the<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cascalog-user"> Cascalog Google group</a> by Jeroen van Dijk

I used <code>write-ov-chipkaart-accesslog-file</code> to create files of random data each with 1 million
lines of simulated log entries. Each file is about 60MB. I then uploaded the files on S3 for the MR
run. I did two runs. The first with 10 of these files and the second with 30 of them.

The Hadoop cluster I used was a 10 node Amazon EMR cluster using Large
EC2 nodes with Amazon's flavor of Hadoop. The output of the Cascalog job was sunk to S3. Each
Cascalog query resulted in a single MapReduce job using 60 map tasks and 17 reduce tasks.

<p>
As you can see the performance on this data is about 18% better for the <code>defparallelagg</code> implementation. I
believe that the performance gain in using aggregating into a single HLL object is offset by the
time needed to shuffle/sort and send the data to the reduce tasks. As the data gets bigger and
bigger this difference will become even more pronounced.
</p>

<p>
So even though the merge implementation is 5x slower than the offer implementation, when run as a
Cascalog job on a cluster with a decent amount of data, the merge implementation is about 15-20%
faster than the offer.
</p>

<p>
I think the key thing to take away from this is that when measuring performance of Cascalog jobs (and
really any MapReduce job) we have to be sure to test on a real cluster using a significant enough
amount of data.
