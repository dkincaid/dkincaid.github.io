I spent three days at O'Reilly's Strata data conference this past week in Santa Clara. This is my second Strata conference. I was at the first one last year in Santa Clara, but missed the fall conference in New York mainly due to the conflict with the Strangeloop conference. Last year's conference was very good and this year's conference was even better. I got much less of a feeling of being vendor rolled this year than I did last year. Part of that might be that I'm getting better at avoiding the talks that are nothing more than marketing pitches.

A couple major things struck me this year compared to last year. The first was Microsoft's presence. Last year I don't even remember if they had a booth and their only talk was a terrible keynote that was nothing more than a marketing pitch for Azure. This year they had quite a large booth, their talks and keynotes were much less Microsoft centric and it seems like they are starting to get it. We'll see if they can execute or if they are too late.

The second thing was EMC's huge booth with the very perky marketing lady giving the same 5 minute spiel over and over again through the whole conference. It was quite annoying and really turned me off. I think they are trying a little too hard to undo the impression that they are just a SAN company in a world that is moving in a different direction.

There were two major themes at the conference I think. One was around the tools that data scientists use such as databases, storage and processing systems and the other was the techniques and applications of data science. The latter is my main interest. While I find things like Hadoop interesting I'm much more interested in the analysis techniques and algorithms and how they are used. So that's going to be my focus in the round up.

I spent Tuesday in the Deep Data all day session. This included several talks from leading data scientists that covered a lot of great content about techniques and applications of data science. I was pleasantly surprised by
