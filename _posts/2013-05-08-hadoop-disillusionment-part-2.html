Last time I wrote about how I came to this point and promised some more details around some of my disappointment with Hadoop as I get deeper into implementing a system on it. In this post I'll discuss in varying detail my top five current issues with the current state of Hadoop. I freely admit that some of this may be a misunderstanding on my part. As I said in the first post I'm a Hadoop newbie climbing the steep learning curve, so I welcome anyone more knowledgeable than I straightening me out.

<h2>1. Configuration</h2>

<h2>2. Windows development environment woes</h2>

<h2>3. Shell scripts and job execution</h2>

<h2>4. Documentation</h2>

<h2>5. The Hadoop code base</h2>
